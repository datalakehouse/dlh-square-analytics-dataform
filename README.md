  params = {
    source_database: 'DEVELOPER_SANDBOX',
    source_schema: 'DEMO_SQUARE_ALT13',
    target_schema: 'DATAFORM_SQUARE',
    ...params
  };
```

Create a new JS file on your `definitions/` folder based with the folowing example:

```javascript
const DATAFORM_SQUARE = require("../node_modules/dlh-dataform-square");
    
const models = DATAFORM_SQUARE({
});
```
